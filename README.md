### Project: `waglpz/webapp-meta`

**Description**:  
The `waglpz/webapp-meta` project serves as a meta-project for creating and managing multiple web application components within a unified framework. It provides a consistent base for various applications while minimizing redundancy in configuration.

**Key Features**:

- **Centralized Dependency Management**:  
  All core dependencies are specified in a single `composer.json` file, ensuring that any derived projects automatically inherit these dependencies. This approach simplifies the management of shared libraries and components across multiple projects.

- **Standardized Scripts**:  
  The project defines a set of reusable scripts that can be utilized across all derived applications. These scripts handle tasks such as code analysis, testing, and code style checks, promoting consistent development practices.

- **Customizable Configurations**:  
  Each derived project can override or extend configurations without duplicating the entire setup. This allows for flexibility while maintaining a coherent structure.

- **OpenAPI Specification Generation**:  
  A dedicated script for generating OpenAPI specifications in JSON format facilitates seamless API documentation for web applications, ensuring that APIs are well-documented and easy to understand.

- **Development and Testing Tools**:  
  The project includes various development tools such as PHPStan for static analysis, PHPUnit for testing, and PHP_CodeSniffer for code style checking, ensuring high code quality and adherence to standards.

- **Extensibility**:  
  The project is designed to be easily extendable, allowing developers to add new features or modify existing ones without significant overhead. This makes it an ideal foundation for a range of web applications, including REST APIs and other components.

**Usage**:  
To create a new project based on this meta-project, simply include `waglpz/webapp-meta` in the `require` section of the derived projectâ€™s `composer.json` file. This will pull in all necessary dependencies and scripts, allowing developers to focus on building their specific application functionality.

**License**:  
The project is licensed under the MIT License, promoting open-source collaboration and sharing.
